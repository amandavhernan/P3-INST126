# Project 3
Group Members: Amanda Hern√°ndez, Alexandra Glick

This is our third project for INST126 at the University of Maryland. For this project, we first assesed a problem statement
and came up with a plan of action that detailed how we would work through the problem. 

The goal of this code is to issue four reports that provide insights in four areas: suspicious activity, irresponsible behavior, system glitches, and domian countes. We will also provide an additional report that looks at which employee works the most. 

## How it works
